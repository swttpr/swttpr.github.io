excerpt: 'Submillimeter-scale ferromagnetic soft continuums own innate skills in performing desirable and delicate bending for confined space navigations, especially in biological lumens. However, such tiny structures are difficult to endow with complex designs, thereby challenging to realize more sophisticated functions for various purposes, especially in vivo therapies and manipulations. Inspired by grafting for muscles and plants, we propose submillimeter-scale ferromagnetic soft continuums that can actively divide into pieces at any region, and reversely, the pieces can actively graft to each other to the original form or novel shapes. We define these functions as self-grafting, containing self-division and self-mergence. Implementing self-grafting implies the need to actively switch between two opposing characteristics: sufficient continuum strength for steering loads and a low fracture strength for division and mergence. Therefore, we developed ferromagnetic thermoplastic soft materials to replace the widely applied thermoset materials for continuums and shed the commonly required coating layers. Being made of the ferromagnetic material family that can conduct reversible elastomer-fluid transitions, the proposed soft continuums can perform desirable division-mergence and navigate confined spaces on par with existing devices. We systematically investigated the fundamental mechanisms of the self-graftable ferromagnetic soft continuums and provided three biomedical demonstrations to showcase the application values of self-grafting: “Continuum carriers” can send multiple sub-continuums for in vivo missions while performing 1000%-2000% stiffness softening/hardening. “Graftable end-effector” can operate gentle airway foreign body removals with ~400% locking force enhancement. “Aided devices” can be applied to conduct thermal ablations and submucosal dissections. Endowed with enhanced flexibility and applicability by self-grafting, the proposed ferromagnetic soft continuums may open a multifunctional path for operating a wider range of biomedical missions.'
