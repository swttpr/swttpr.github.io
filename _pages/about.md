I am a second year PhD student under Prof. REN Hongliang, at CUHK EE, Hong Kong.

My current thesis research focuses on magnetic soft robots and their medical applications.

I am also interested in mechanical hardware settings, as my undergraduate and master's backgrounds are in Mechanical Engineering (e-vehicles, quadrotors, etc.)
